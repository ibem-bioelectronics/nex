## *nex* platform for neuroscience research

*nex* is an integrated hardware/software platform for neuroscience research, targeted at use cases requiring a small, lightweight form factor (e.g. small animal research), fully implantable packaging (e.g. chronic experiments), and closed-loop neuromodulation. The platform consists of:

* _hardware_ (nexhw): a printed circuit board (PCB) design sized for applications as small as mouse implants
* _firmware_ (nexfw): power-optimized code that runs on the implanted device, controlling a stimulation engine and transmitting recorded biosignals
* _transceiver_ (nextrx): code for a USB device to transmit/receive data between a PC and the implanted device
* _communication protocol_ (nexdp): a lightweight and ultrafast protocol for communication with data telemetry implants
* _user interface_ (nexui): an application for real-time data visualization and system control
